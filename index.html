    How 'oft have I, thy unrequited love,
    Seen fit to call thy name 'divine'; aloud
    Unto the stars, and them that watch above,
    I yell it clear and still remain as proud.

    Sweet golden locks, that shame the finest silk,
    And make the worm to spin its gild no more;
    Soft voice, belike unto the Siren's ilk,
    As if a mariner I feel its lure.

    Thy virtues true I gladly do extol,
    Wax lyrical on features heaven sent,
    Beauty of angels hath the gods 'ere lent, 
    Yet in me, these gifts, they do take their toll.

    F'rin me one flaw the Lord did'st gleeful make;
    My love, for you, I'll 'till my dying take.
